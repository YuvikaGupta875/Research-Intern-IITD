 **Cyclone & Low-Pressure System Detection using UNet**
**Remote Research Project @ IIT Delhi | Nov 2024 â€“ Jul 2025**

This repository presents a machine learning-based approach to track low-pressure systems (LPS) and improve cyclone prediction accuracy using meteorological data. The project was conducted under the guidance of researchers at IIT Delhi, focusing on monsoon analysis, sea-level pressure (SLP) patterns, and automated contour detection in climate maps.


**Objective**
To design and evaluate a deep learning model that can:

Detect closed, isolated contours indicative of cyclonic systems

Improve the early warning systems for monsoon-related weather events

Assist meteorologists by automating pressure anomaly identification



 **Techniques Used**
UNet architecture for semantic segmentation of pressure maps

Sea-Level Pressure (SLP) data preprocessing and normalization

Contour detection for identifying LPS zones

Evaluation metrics: IoU, Precision/Recall, and custom geospatial checks



 **Research Impact**
This work contributes to climate informatics and disaster readiness by integrating AI for early detection of low-pressure systems, enabling better monsoon forecasting and cyclone preparedness.
